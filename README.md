# poedit-connector

This module is designed to connect the api from the [POEditor Service](https://poeditor.com). You can use the module in your own code as well with the CLI.

## Getting Started

### Install the module via npm

```
npm i --save --save-exact poedit-connector
```

### Requirements

You must have at least Node v8 installed since this module works with async await.


### Use module in your project

To use this module in your project it's necessary to require the module:

```
const poconnect = require('poedit-connector');
```

## Use API Calls:

### Projects

#### list

##### ([Click hier to see the api docs](https://poeditor.com/docs/api#projects_list))

```
const poconnect = require('poedit-connector');
const token = 'abcdef';

(async () => {
  try {
    const res = await poconnect.projects.list(token);

    // res => { projects: [] };
  } catch (err) {
    // err => returns an error when failed
  }
})();
```

#### add

##### ([Click hier to see the api docs](https://poeditor.com/docs/api#projects_add))

```
const poconnect = require('poedit-connector');
const name = 'MyProjectName';
const description = 'Some description to the project';
const token = 'abcdef';

(async () => {
  try {
    const res = await poconnect.projects.add(token, name, description);

    // res => { projects: [] };
  } catch (err) {
    // err => returns an error when failed
  }
})();
```

This function will get all projects by your access token from the api and check if the project name alredy exist. Is it true, the function rejects an error.
